If we don't know the length of the list we can use 2 pointers (slow and fast). When fast
pointer reaches the tail, slow pointer will be on the middle of the list.

We also use multiple pointers for different traversal techniques, such as kth element from
the tail.

Data structure with multiple pointers called skip list and allows log n search with
insertion.
