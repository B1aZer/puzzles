List is very flexible, it allows us to mimic different data structures. Such as:

 - string
 - stack
 - queue
 - tree
 - graph
 - matrix
 - record

We know that in JavaScript Array is an Object, and Object internally is a Linked List or a
Hash Table (or both). Which means every data structure can be mimicked with only those
primitives.
