General tips:

 - Always start function with edge cases
 - Resist temptation to run code. If you can't test on asserts
 - Test function on 0,1,2 elements first then on general cases
 - If you can't test from arguments, try to test from result (bottom-> top)
 - DONT start with ideal solution in head. WRITE base case and optimize.

Be aware of operator precedence.
