Permutations (5 places of 5 items)

```
5!
```
General formula

```
nPr = n! / (n-k)!

```

5 items on 3 places

```

5*4*3

5! / (5-3)!
```

All Possible non-repeating

```
n^c
n - num of items
c - num of places
```

Zero factorial

```
0! = 1
```

Combinations

```
all perm / # of ways you can arrenge them
```

How many 3 letter combinations of 6 letters?

```
120 / 6
```

General formula. Binomial koefficients. Put k items in n buckets. Or choose k from n buckets (n k).

```
C = n! / k! (n - k)!
```

N choose 2 is equal to n(n - 1)/2. It's a one of the cases from binomial
coefficients (n choose k). See also binomail theorem.

As we all know there are 2^N possible subsets of any given set with N elements

Binomail coefficents as well as subset of the set can be calculated using Pascal's triangle!
