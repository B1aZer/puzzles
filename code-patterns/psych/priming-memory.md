Priming is a phenomenon whereby exposure to one stimulus influences a response
to a subsequent stimulus, without conscious guidance or intention. For
example, the word NURSE is recognized more quickly following the word DOCTOR
than following the word BREAD. Priming can be perceptual, associative,
repetitive, positive, negative, affective, semantic, or conceptual. Research,
however, has yet to firmly establish the duration of priming effects, yet
their onset can be almost instantaneous.

Priming works most effectively when the two stimuli are in the same modality.
For example, visual priming works best with visual cues and verbal priming
works best with verbal cues. But priming also occurs between modalities, or
between semantically related words such as "doctor" and "nurse".

The terms positive and negative priming refer to
when priming affects the speed of processing. A positive prime speeds up
processing, while a negative prime lowers the speed to slower than un-primed
levels.
while negative priming is caused by experiencing the stimulus, and then
ignoring it. Positive priming effects happen even if the prime is not
consciously seen. The effects of positive and negative priming are visible
in event-related potential (ERP) readings.

Positive priming is thought to be caused by spreading activation. This
means that the first stimulus activates parts of a particular representation or
association in memory just before carrying out an action or task. The
representation is already partially activated when the second stimulus is
encountered, so less additional activation is needed for one to become
consciously aware of it.

Negative priming is more difficult to explain. Many models have been
hypothesized, but currently the most widely accepted are the distractor
inhibition and episodic retrieval models. In the distractor inhibition
model, the activation of ignored stimuli is inhibited by the brain. The
episodic retrieval model hypothesizes that ignored items are flagged
'do-not-respond' by the brain. Later, when the brain acts to retrieve this
information, the tag causes a conflict. The time taken to resolve this conflict
causes negative priming. Although both models are still valid, recent
scientific research has led scientists to lean away from the distractor
inhibitor model.
