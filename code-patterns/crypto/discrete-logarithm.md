3 is prime root modulo of 7 because

3 ^ x mod 7 &#2261; y

Where x &#2208; [1,7], y &#2208; [1,7].

y is an element set of [1,7] in a random order.

Or in other terms create uniformly random distribution.

It's practically hard to find x, because there are no algorithm to do so. Known
as discrete logarithm problem.

Discrete logarithm LOG b A, is an integer k such that b ^ k = a.

Discrete logarithms only computable in special cases.
