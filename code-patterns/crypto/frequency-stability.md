Imagine a room with one light. A person in this room lights bulb randomly with
a coin flip. In another room a person tries to randomly switch a bulb. Can we
say what sequence is random?

We can. If we analyze all possible combinations and their frequency, we will see that
person without coin is following a pattern, thus her sequence will not be uniform.

We can simulate random distribution with binary XOR.

AND returns 0 in 75% of cases.

OR returns 1 in 75% of cases.

XOR returns 1 or 0 in 50% of cases.
