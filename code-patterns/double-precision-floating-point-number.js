/* JS uses double point numbers with 52 bits of mantissa.
 * Numbers larger than 2^52 loses precision. See Machine epsilon.
 *
 * That is the reason any operations (most frequently - multiplication)
 * of large numbers ( e.g. 0xffffffff) will give incorrect result.
 *
 * Math.imul(a,b) multiplies a and b as though they were
 * 32 bit signed integers.
 *
 * (a*b)|0 tries to emulate this operation until 2^53 issue is encountered.
 *
 * | 0 can also be used to floor numbers (until the above issue).
