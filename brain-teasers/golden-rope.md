There is a ceiling a hundred feet above you that extends forever, and hanging
from it side-by-side are two golden ropes, each a hundred feet long. You have a
knife, and would like to steal as much of the golden ropes as you can. You are
able to climb ropes, but not survive falls. How much golden rope can you get
away with, and how? Assume you have as many hands as you like.

### Solution

###### 2 ropes into 1, make ring from 1 and pass 2 through it.
