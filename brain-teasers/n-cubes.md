Imagine a cubic array made up of a 3×3×3 arrangement of smaller cubes: The cubic
array is three cubes wide, three cubes high, and three cubes deep.

How many of the cubes are on the surface of the cubic array?

Now imagine that you have a 4×4×4 cubic array of cubes. How many cubes are on
the surface of this array?

A cube is an object that measures the same distance across in three
perpendicular directions in a three-dimensional space. A four-dimensional
hypercube is an object that measures the same distance across in four
perpendicular directions in a fourdimensional space. Calculate the number of 4D
hypercubes on the surface of an n×n×n×n hypercubic array of 4D hypercubes.

### Solution

n^i-(n-2)^i
