You are given two fuses and a lighter. When lit, each fuse takes exactly one hour to
burn from one end to the other. The fuses do not burn at a constant rate, though, and
they are not identical. In other words, you may make no assumptions about the relationship between the length of a section of fuse and the time it has taken or will
take to burn. Two equal lengths of fuse will not necessarily take the same time to
burn. Using only the fuses and the lighter, measure a period of exactly 40 minutes.

### Solution

###### If the fuse can be reused, than we can make a ring from second fuse and use first fuse as delimeter. Meaning split time of burning of second fuse to equal intervals. Each equal to the one from first fuse. If the interval is 10 minutes we can use it to measure 40 minutes.

###### If they can't be reused we can make interval of 5 seconds by simple counting 5 in our mind and making marks on fuse. We can be sure we counted properly if fuse sums up to 1 hour.

###### If we can move with infinite speed. We can use time dilation to slowdown fuse burning. We move at the 95% of speed of light which slows time approximately by 1/3. Thus one fuse lighted at this speed will burn in 20m of Earth observer time. Two fuses will give us 40 minutes.

###### Begin from both starts
