You have eight marbles and a two-pan balance. All the marbles weigh the same,
except for one, which is heavier than all the others. The marbles are otherwise
indistinguishable. You may make no assumptions about how much heavier the heavy
marble is. What is the minimum number of weighings needed to be certain of
identifying the heavy marble?

### Solution

###### Ternary weighting
