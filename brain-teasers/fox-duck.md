A duck, pursued by a fox, escapes to the center of a perfectly circular pond.
The fox cannot swim, and the duck cannot take flight from the water (itâ€™s a
deficient duck).  The fox is four times faster than the duck. Assuming the fox
and duck pursue optimum strategies, is it possible for the duck to reach the
edge of the pond and fly away without being eaten? If so, how?

### Solution

###### If duck will start from center, she will reach arc later than fox, since 4r < pr.  But duck should not start from center, she could start from 3/4 circumference of initial circle. If we paint another circle inside main circle wtih 3/4 circumference, than duck moves faster insider this circle, the same as fox on circle, and slower outside, (comparing to fox moving on the circle). That's because arc of the smaller circle 4 times less than arc with the same angle of the outside circle.  We can prove this with arc/2pr = a/360. So duck moving inside the circle can create angle faster than fox. She can use it to align herself on the diameter of bigger circle with the fox on the same diamter. After that it takes her 3/4r distance to reach shore, which is less 2pr/2 distance that takes fox to get to the same spot.
