Two boys walking in the woods decided to take a shortcut through a railroad
tunnel.  When they had walked 2 ⁄3 of the way through the tunnel, their worst
fears were realized. A train was coming in the opposite direction, nearing the
tunnel entrance. The boys panicked and each ran for a different end of the
tunnel. Both boys ran at the same speed, 10 miles per hour. Each boy escaped
from the tunnel just at the instant that the train would have squashed him into
the rails. Assuming the train’s speed was constant, and both boys were capable
of instantaneous reaction and acceleration, how fast was the train going?

### Solution

###### We know that when train enters the tunnel second boy has 1/3 of disatnce left to cover. If they reach the end of tunnel almost at the same time, train goes 3 times faster than boy.
