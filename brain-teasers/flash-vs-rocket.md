Flash can accelerate to relational speed (speed of light). Let's say rocket can
accelerate to the same speed. There is man in a rocket. For this man rocket
works as time machine. When he steps into rocket for 3s and exits, he sees that
he exits to the future and 1 earth hour has passed. But when flash accelerates
to the same speed as rocket, for him time slows, after 1 hour he stops and sees
that only 3s of Earth time has passed. Why the time differ for both of them,
even though he traveled on the same speed?
