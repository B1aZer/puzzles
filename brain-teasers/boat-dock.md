You are sitting in a small boat, holding the end of a rope. The other end of
the rope is tied to the top of a nearby pier, such that it is higher above the
water than your end of the rope. You pull on the rope, causing your boat to

rope, which of the following is faster: the speed the boat moves across the
water or the speed the rope moves through your hands?
